Asami is a Discord bot without any current goals written in
https://rust-lang.org[Rust]. In its current state, it works fine, but has no
proper use.

Please don't look at the source, it's all a big shitfest.

== Usage

. Get https://rustup.rs[Rust using Rustup].
. Compile using `cargo build --release`, potentially for some other target
triple than the compiling system.
. Install https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSql] using your package manager or
installer of choice. This is required to be running properly configured with
the table setups found in link:src/scheme.rs[scheme.rs].
. Run the bot once and fix the `config.toml` file with correct information.
. Get a bot token from <https://discordapp.com/developers>.
. Run the bot as one usually would and start using it. The owner of the bot will
be automatically fetched upon every start.

== Dependency Graph

A Rust program without a dependency graph would be incomplete.
The graph was generated using `cargo deps --all-deps | dot -Tpng >| graph.png`.
